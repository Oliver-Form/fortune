```

### Component-Based Entity System
Built on Bevy's powerful ECS architecture:
- **Components**: Pure data structures (Position, Velocity, Health)
- **Systems**: Logic functions that operate on component queries
- **Resources**: Global game state and configuration
- **Events**: Decoupled communication between systems

### Efficient Data Structures
- **Spatial Partitioning**: QuadTree-based chunk organization
- **Memory Pools**: Reusable entity and component allocation
- **Cache-Friendly Access**: Optimized component layouts
- **Minimal Allocations**: Zero-allocation hot paths where possible

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

### Visual Map Editor
**Web-based editor** for creating and editing game worlds:
- Real-time tile painting with multiple brush tools
- Performance-optimized for massive maps (4096√ó4096)
- Chunk-based rendering for smooth editing
- Import/export in multiple formats
- Collaborative editing support

### CLI Utilities
**Command-line tools** for automated world generation:
```bash
# Procedural generation
./tools/generate_world.py --biomes desert,grass --size 4096

# Batch processing
./tools/convert_images.py *.png --output-format map

# Performance analysis
./tools/analyze_chunks.py world.map --profile memory
```

### Asset Pipeline
**Streamlined workflow** for game content:
- Automatic texture optimization and compression
- 3D model validation and LOD generation
- Animation compression and validation
- Hot-reload during development

## üéÆ Game Framework

### State Management
Flexible game state system supporting:
- **Menu States**: Main menu, settings, pause screens
- **Gameplay States**: Playing, cutscenes, inventory
- **Transition System**: Smooth state changes with loading screens
- **Save/Load**: Persistent world and player state

### Physics Integration
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient spatial queries and response
- **Character Physics**: Ground detection, slope handling
- **Trigger Volumes**: Area-based events and interactions
- **Performance Scaling**: Adaptive physics quality based on load

### Audio Framework
- **3D Positional Audio**: Distance and direction-based sound
- **Music System**: Layered, adaptive background music
- **Sound Effects**: Event-driven audio with pooling
- **Performance**: Low-latency audio with minimal overhead

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- **World Size**: Tested up to 16M+ tiles (4096¬≤)
- **Draw Calls**: Batched rendering for thousands of objects
- **Memory Usage**: Configurable LOD and culling systems
- **Frame Rate**: Consistent 60+ FPS on modest hardware

### Optimization Features
- **Frustum Culling**: Only render visible geometry
- **LOD System**: Distance-based detail reduction
- **Occlusion Culling**: Hide objects behind terrain
- **Batch Rendering**: Minimize GPU state changes

## üîß Configuration
